        <h2>Transparency, Satisfaction, Optimization</h2>
        <p>The primary intend of this project is to give every employee an overview of existing projects, customers and fellow colleagues. There are several dashboards that allow simple project
          staffing with employees that live close to the customer. Employees on the other hand can check out existing customers in their neighbourhood, to be part of the next project team. It is also
          useful to find colleagues that have been at a customer before.</p>

      <h2>Satisfaction</h2>
      <p>Every time managers need to staff new projects they can check who will be available at the project start and decide which possible candidate lives closest to the customer. The dashboards
        allow employees to proactively check out projects in their area or technologies used in projects that they would like to use as well.</p>
